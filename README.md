### Summary
  - Overall, a great website that anyone can access to and view the UFO sighting data. 
  - Drawbacks: 
    - Search is pretty limited where the parameters are exactly as entered.  You cannot search multiple states, greater/less than dates, or wildcard entries. 
  - Potentail Improvements:
    - Add search parameters that are conditional. I.E.  Before 2015 and after 2009.     
    - Clean up the values in each header. 
      - All values are lower case which is odd for states and cities.
      - Fix duration time format to a standard.  There are too many variation of time entries that could be easier to read if the word "mins" only appear and not min or         minutes.  Also, only the numerical value and text of time as the standard.    
      - Have consistent text for similar words like other, unknown under the "Shape" column.
